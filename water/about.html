        <h2><i>Our Story</i></h2>

        <p>Founded in 2022 by Puja Barman, JalSeva was born out of a simple yet powerful vision — to make clean and safe
            drinking water accessible to everyone, everywhere. Starting from Cooch Behar, a small town with big
            challenges, Puja saw the daily struggles people faced just to get drinking water. She believed technology
            could bridge this gap.

            What started as a small initiative has now grown into a tech-driven water supply
            network that connects customers to certified water distributors through an
            easy-to-use mobile app. Whether you’re in the heart of the city or in a rural
            village, JalSeva brings trusted brands like Bisleri and Bailley to your doorstep
            within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
        <h2><i>Our Goal</i></h2>
        <p>At JalSeva, our goal is simple — to make clean, safe, and reliable drinking
            water available to every household, workplace, and event, without hassle.

            We aim to eliminate the daily struggle of accessing pure water by offering
            an easy, transparent, and tech-enabled platform. With just a few taps,
            customers can schedule deliveries of trusted ISI-certified brands —
            ensuring health and convenience go hand in hand.

            Our long-term vision goes beyond delivery. We are building a sustainable
            water ecosystem that empowers local distributors, reduces plastic waste,
            and supports smart water usage across India.

            Whether you are in an urban city or a remote village, JalSeva is committed
            to being your most reliable partner in hydration — delivering water that’s
            not just safe, but also responsibly sourced and efficiently managed.</p>
        <h2>
